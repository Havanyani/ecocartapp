## Newly Implemented Features

### Real AI Service Integration

The AI Assistant now supports integration with real AI services:

1. **AIServiceAdapter Interface**: Created a flexible adapter interface that allows for multiple AI service implementations
2. **OpenAI Integration**: Implemented OpenAI as the first supported service with GPT model support
3. **Configuration UI**: Added a dedicated screen for users to input and manage their API keys
4. **Status Indicators**: Enhanced the UI to show the current AI service status and configuration
5. **Graceful Degradation**: System automatically falls back to offline mode when AI services are unavailable

### Security Enhancements

1. **Secure Key Storage**: API keys are stored securely using AsyncStorage
2. **Rate Limiting**: Client-side rate limiting prevents excessive API usage and costs
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for API failures
4. **Privacy Notices**: Clear communication about data usage in AI interactions

## Notes

The AI Assistant is now capable of providing intelligent responses using real AI services while maintaining full offline functionality. The system is designed to be easily extended with additional AI service providers in the future.
