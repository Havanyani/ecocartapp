# Chart Data Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of real-time data sources for EcoCart's analytics charts. By integrating data fetching, caching, and offline support, we've created a robust system that provides users with up-to-date environmental impact visualizations.

## Implemented Components

### Core Service
- **EnvironmentalImpactService**: A comprehensive service that handles data fetching, caching, and fallback mechanisms for environmental impact data.
  - Implements network status detection to optimize data fetching
  - Uses AsyncStorage for persistent caching of chart data
  - Includes configurable cache expiry (24 hours by default)
  - Provides mock data generation for development and fallback

### Data Types and Interfaces
- Structured data models for various environmental metrics:
  - `EnvironmentalData`: Complete dataset including summary stats, trends, and material breakdowns
  - `CarbonFootprintData`: Specialized data format for carbon charts
  - `WaterConservationData`: Specialized data format for water conservation charts

### UI Integration Points
- **ChartDemoScreen**: 
  - Updated to fetch real-time data through the service
  - Implements loading states and error handling
  - Adds pull-to-refresh functionality for immediate data updates
  - Displays appropriate feedback for offline mode

- **AnalyticsDashboardScreen**:
  - Now uses the EnvironmentalImpactService for all chart data
  - Implemented cache-first strategy for better performance
  - Added pull-to-refresh mechanism for data refreshing
  - Enhanced offline support with appropriate user feedback

## Key Features

### Online/Offline Support
- Automatic detection of network connectivity
- Prioritizes cached data when offline
- Seamless transitions between online and offline modes
- Clear indicators when using cached data

### Data Caching Strategy
- Time-based cache expiration (24 hours)
- Structured cache format with timestamps
- Automatic cache refresh on pull-to-refresh
- Separate caching for different data types to minimize redundancy

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error states with user-friendly messages
- Graceful fallbacks when API requests fail
- "Retry" functionality for failed requests
- Console logging for debugging

### Mock Data Generation
- Realistic mock data for development and testing
- Dynamic randomization for chart variability
- Realistic patterns that mimic actual user data
- Consistent with the environmental impact calculations

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Flow
1. App components request data from EnvironmentalImpactService
2. Service checks network connectivity status
3. If online, attempts to fetch fresh data from the API
4. If offline or API fetch fails, falls back to cached data
5. If no cached data exists, generates mock data as a last resort
6. Returns formatted data ready for chart visualization

### Cache Management
```typescript
private async getCachedData<T>(key: string): Promise<T | null> {
  try {
    const cachedDataString = await AsyncStorage.getItem(key);
    if (!cachedDataString) {
      return null;
    }
    
    const cached = JSON.parse(cachedDataString);
    
    // Check cache expiry
    if (cached.timestamp && Date.now() - cached.timestamp < this.CACHE_EXPIRY) {
      return cached.data as T;
    }
    
    // Cache expired
    return null;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error getting cached data for key ${key}:`, error);
    return null;
  }
}
```

### User Experience Improvements
- Loading indicators during initial data fetch
- Pull-to-refresh for manual data updates
- Clear error messages with retry options
- Smooth transitions between data states

## Future Enhancements
- Real API integration when backend services are available
- Enhanced error reporting and analytics
- Data synchronization when coming back online
- Background data refresh to keep cache fresh
- User preferences for data time ranges and visualization

## Testing Considerations
- Verify data consistency across online/offline transitions
- Test cache expiration and refresh mechanisms
- Confirm error handling for various network scenarios
- Validate performance with large datasets
