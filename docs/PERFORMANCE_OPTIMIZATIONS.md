# EcoCart Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented for the EcoCart mobile application.

## Performance Monitoring Service

The `PerformanceMonitorService` has been enhanced to track various metrics:

- **Render Times**: Tracks how long components take to render
- **API Response Times**: Monitors API call performance
- **Error Tracking**: Captures and reports errors with context
- **Network Monitoring**: Tracks network request performance

### Usage

```typescript
import { performanceMonitor } from '@/services/PerformanceMonitorService';

// Track render performance
performanceMonitor.markRenderStart('HomeScreen');
// ...rendering logic
performanceMonitor.markRenderEnd('HomeScreen');

// Track API calls
const requestId = 'fetch-products-123';
performanceMonitor.markApiStart(requestId, '/api/products');
// ...API call
performanceMonitor.markApiEnd(requestId, { productCount: 25 });

// Capture errors
try {
  // ...code that might throw
} catch (error) {
  performanceMonitor.captureError(error, { 
    context: 'ProductList', 
    action: 'loadData' 
  });
}
```

## API Service Optimizations

The API service has been optimized with:

- **Increased Timeout**: Default timeout increased to 30 seconds for better reliability on slow connections
- **Smart Retry Logic**: Automatically retries failed requests with exponential backoff
- **Error Classification**: Errors are now categorized for better debugging and reporting

## Error Handling Consolidation

We've consolidated multiple ErrorBoundary implementations into a single `ConsolidatedErrorBoundary` component:

- **Unified Error UI**: Consistent error experience across the app
- **Performance Tracking**: Automatically logs errors to the performance monitoring service
- **Recovery Options**: Provides retry functionality for users

### Usage

```tsx
import { ErrorBoundary } from '@/components/error';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary componentName="ProductList">
      {/* Your component content */}
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}
```

## Implementation Details

1. **Singleton Pattern**: The PerformanceMonitorService uses a singleton pattern with static methods delegating to the instance for backward compatibility.

2. **Error Boundary Consolidation**: Removed duplicate ErrorBoundary implementations (in ui/, common/, and error/ directories) and created a single source of truth.

3. **Proper Error Tracking**: Integrated error boundary with performance monitoring to ensure all React errors are properly tracked.

## Future Optimizations

Planned performance improvements:

1. **Image Optimization**: Implement progressive loading and WebP format
2. **Code Splitting**: Reduce initial bundle size with dynamic imports
3. **Virtualized Lists**: Use FlatList with optimized rendering for large data sets
4. **Memory Management**: Implement cleanup in useEffect hooks to prevent memory leaks
