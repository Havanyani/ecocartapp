### Startup Performance

The EcoCart app implements several strategies to optimize startup time and improve the perceived performance:

#### App Initialization

- **Early Performance Tracking**: The app sets a timestamp as early as possible in the app lifecycle (`global.appStartTimestamp`) to accurately measure startup time.
- **Splash Screen Management**: Uses `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()` to keep the native splash screen visible while React Native initializes.
- **Centralized Initialization**: The `AppInitializer` singleton manages all initialization tasks, including asset preloading and performance optimization setup.
- **Asset Preloading**: Critical assets (fonts, images) are preloaded during initialization to prevent UI flickering during navigation.
- **Progressive Loading**: The `AppLoadingScreen` component shows loading progress with animations to improve perceived performance.
- **Adaptive Optimization**: The `detectOptimizationProfile` function determines the appropriate level of optimization based on device capabilities and network conditions.

```typescript
// Example: Detecting optimization profile
export async function detectOptimizationProfile(): Promise<OptimizationProfile> {
  // Check network status
  const networkState = await getNetworkStateAsync();
  
  // Determine profile based on connection type and platform
  if (networkState.type === 'cellular') {
    return 'low';
  }
  
  return 'high';
}
```

### Image Optimization

The app implements a comprehensive image optimization strategy through the `OptimizedImage` component:

#### Features

- **Automatic Sizing**: Images are resized based on container or screen dimensions to avoid loading unnecessarily large assets.
- **Progressive Loading**: Implements blur-up technique with blurhash placeholders for a smoother loading experience.
- **Format Optimization**: Converts images to WebP when supported for better compression.
- **Caching Strategy**: Implements a sophisticated disk and memory caching system to avoid redundant downloads.
- **Lazy Loading**: Images outside the viewport can be loaded with lower priority or deferred.
- **Performance Tracking**: Image loading and rendering times are tracked for monitoring and optimization.

```tsx
// Example: Using the OptimizedImage component
<OptimizedImage
  source={{ uri: 'https://example.com/image.jpg' }}
  contentFit="cover"
  blurhash="LKO2:N%2Tw=w]~RBVZRi};RPxuwH"
  lazyLoad={true}
  priority="normal"
/>
```

### Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

The app implements code splitting and lazy loading to reduce the initial bundle size and improve startup performance:

#### LazyScreen Component

- **Dynamic Imports**: The `LazyScreen` component uses dynamic imports to load screens on demand.
- **Custom Loading States**: Configurable loading component displays while the screen loads.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for failed imports.
- **Performance Tracking**: Screen load and render times are measured for optimization.
- **Preloading**: Frequently accessed screens can be preloaded to improve navigation performance.

```typescript
// Example: Creating a lazy-loaded screen
const AnalyticsDashboard = createLazyScreen(
  'AnalyticsDashboard',
  () => import('@/screens/analytics/AnalyticsDashboard'),
  { preload: false }
);
```

#### BundleSplitter Utility

- **Platform-Specific Code**: Platform-specific bundles reduce bundle size for both Android and iOS.
- **Feature Flagging**: Components can be conditionally loaded based on feature flags.
- **Component Registry**: The `BundleSplitter` class maintains a registry of lazy-loaded components for monitoring and preloading.

### Network Optimization

Network performance optimizations include:

- **Offline Support**: The app can function without a network connection using cached data.
- **Request Batching**: Similar requests are batched to reduce network overhead.
- **Request Prioritization**: Critical requests receive higher priority than non-critical ones.
- **Compression**: Network requests use compression when supported.
- **Prefetching**: Data for likely user navigation paths is prefetched.
- **Adaptive Concurrency**: The number of concurrent network requests is adjusted based on network conditions.

### UI Rendering Optimization

To ensure smooth UI rendering, the app implements:

- **Virtualized Lists**: Long lists use `FlatList` with virtualization to optimize rendering.
- **Memoization**: `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` are used to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **Optimized Animations**: The `react-native-reanimated` library is used for performant animations that run on the UI thread.
- **Debouncing and Throttling**: User interactions that trigger expensive operations are debounced or throttled.
- **CSS Optimizations**: Shadows, blur, and other expensive CSS properties are used judiciously.

### Performance Monitoring

The app includes a built-in performance monitoring system:

- **Metrics Collection**: The `PerformanceMonitor` class collects various metrics including render times, network latency, and memory usage.
- **Performance Reporting**: Performance data can be exported for analysis.
- **Automated Alerts**: Alerts are triggered when performance falls below acceptable thresholds.
- **User Experience Metrics**: Core Web Vitals such as First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Time to Interactive (TTI) are tracked.

### Testing Performance

Performance testing is an integral part of the development process:

- **Unit Tests**: Components like `OptimizedImage`, `LazyScreen`, and `AppInitializer` have dedicated unit tests to verify performance-related functionality.
- **Integration Tests**: Verify that performance optimization systems work together correctly.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Validate real-world performance with timing assertions like "app should initialize within 5 seconds."
- **Performance Regression Testing**: Performance metrics are compared across builds to identify regressions.
- **Device Testing**: Performance is tested across various device tiers to ensure a good experience on all supported devices.

```typescript
// Example: End-to-end test for app initialization performance
it('should complete initialization within 5 seconds', async () => {
  const startTime = Date.now();
  
  // Wait for loading screen to appear
  await waitFor(element(by.text('EcoCart')))
    .toBeVisible()
    .withTimeout(2000);
  
  // Wait for loading to complete and home screen to appear
  await waitFor(element(by.id('home-screen')))
    .toBeVisible()
    .withTimeout(5000);
  
  const endTime = Date.now();
  const loadTime = endTime - startTime;
  
  // Assert that initialization completed within 5 seconds
  if (loadTime >= 5000) {
    throw new Error(`App initialization took too long: ${loadTime}ms (expected < 5000ms)`);
  }
});
```

By applying these optimization strategies, the EcoCart app provides an optimal user experience across a wide range of devices and network conditions. The performance optimization system is designed to be adaptive, automatically adjusting to the capabilities of the user's device and network environment.
