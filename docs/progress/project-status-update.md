# EcoCart Project Status Update
*Date: March 29, 2025*

## Current Status

The EcoCart project is progressing well according to the revised timeline. We have completed Week 2 deliverables for the AR Container Recognition feature, including comprehensive testing and documentation of the crowdsourced container recognition system.

## Completed Features

### AR Container Recognition System
- **Core scanning functionality**: Users can scan containers using device camera
- **Container recognition**: System identifies common recycling containers
- **Environmental impact calculations**: Displays CO2, water, and energy savings
- **Crowdsourced contributions**: Users can submit unrecognized containers
- **Verification system**: Community verification ensures data quality
- **Admin management**: Administrative tools for database management

### Testing Framework
- Unit tests for environmental impact calculations
- Component tests for all UI elements
- Integration tests for complete user flows
- Test coverage for edge cases and error handling

### Documentation
- Updated README with feature information
- Detailed documentation on the crowdsourced recognition system
- Implementation guides for future developers
- Progress reports for stakeholders

## Next Week Deliverables (Week 3)

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize AR scanning for lower-end devices
   - Implement caching for container recognition
   - Reduce memory usage during camera operations

2. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Add visual feedback during scanning process
   - Implement haptic feedback for successful scans
   - Create onboarding flow for first-time users

3. **Backend Integration**
   - Connect with cloud services for data persistence
   - Implement container database synchronization
   - Set up analytics for feature usage tracking

## Timeline Assessment

The project is currently **on schedule** according to the revised timeline. Week 2 deliverables have been completed successfully, and preparations for Week 3 tasks are underway.

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| AR performance on low-end devices | Medium | High | Implement progressive enhancement and fallback options |
| Database scalability for crowdsourced data | Low | Medium | Design efficient storage schema and implement pagination |
| User adoption of contribution system | Medium | Medium | Create incentive system and streamlined contribution process |

## Action Items

1. Begin implementation of performance optimizations
2. Design user experience enhancements for scanning flow
3. Prepare backend architecture for cloud integration
4. Schedule user testing for contribution system

## Conclusion

The AR Container Recognition feature is progressing well, with strong testing coverage and comprehensive documentation. The crowdsourced container recognition system adds significant value to the application by allowing the community to contribute to the materials database, enhancing the app's recycling guidance capabilities over time.
