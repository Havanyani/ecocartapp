# Environmental Impact Sharing

## Overview
The Environmental Impact Sharing feature enables users to share their recycling achievements and environmental contributions with their social networks. This feature translates users' recycling activities into meaningful environmental impact metrics and provides visually appealing, shareable content that highlights their positive contributions to sustainability efforts.

## User-Facing Functionality
- **Impact Dashboard**: Personalized dashboard showing cumulative environmental impact metrics
- **Shareable Cards**: Pre-designed visual cards with impact statistics for social sharing
- **Achievement Milestones**: Special shareable content triggered by reaching recycling milestones
- **Comparative Metrics**: User's impact compared to community averages or global benchmarks
- **Integration with Social Platforms**: Direct sharing to popular social media platforms
- **Impact Storytelling**: Narrative content that contextualizes environmental metrics
- **Custom Sharing Options**: Controls for selecting which metrics to include in shared content

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Design Pattern(s)**: Factory Pattern for creating share content, Adapter Pattern for social platform integration
- **Key Components**: 
  - `EnvironmentalImpactService`: Calculates and formats impact metrics
  - `ShareableContentFactory`: Generates visual content for sharing
  - `SocialSharingManager`: Handles platform-specific sharing functionality
- **Dependencies**: 
  - React Native Share API
  - ViewShot for generating shareable images
  - Expo FileSystem for temporary file storage
  - Social platform SDKs (optional)

### Code Structure
```typescript
// Environmental impact metrics interface
interface EnvironmentalImpactMetrics {
  recyclablesMass: number; // in kg
  co2Saved: number; // in kg
  waterSaved: number; // in liters
  energySaved: number; // in kWh
  treesEquivalent: number; // equivalent number of trees
  wasteDiverted: number; // percentage of waste diverted from landfill
}

// Shareable content configuration
interface ShareConfig {
  metrics: (keyof EnvironmentalImpactMetrics)[]; // Metrics to include
  template: 'standard' | 'achievement' | 'milestone' | 'comparison';
  platform?: 'facebook' | 'twitter' | 'instagram' | 'whatsapp' | 'generic';
  includeUserName?: boolean;
  caption?: string;
}

// Example of generating and sharing impact content
async function shareEnvironmentalImpact(
  userId: string, 
  timeRange: 'week' | 'month' | 'year' | 'all-time',
  config: ShareConfig
): Promise<boolean> {
  try {
    // Get user's environmental impact data
    const impactData = await EnvironmentalImpactService.getUserImpactData(userId, timeRange);
    
    // Generate shareable content based on configuration
    const shareableContent = ShareableContentFactory.createContent(
      impactData, 
      config
    );
    
    // Generate image from content component
    const uri = await ViewShot.captureRef(shareableContent.ref, {
      format: 'jpg',
      quality: 0.9
    });
    
    // Share the image with the appropriate platform
    const result = await SocialSharingManager.shareImage({
      uri,
      platform: config.platform,
      caption: config.caption || shareableContent.defaultCaption,
      hashtags: ['EcoCart', 'Sustainability', 'RecyclingHero']
    });
    
    // Log sharing analytics
    AnalyticsService.logSharingEvent({
      userId,
      timeRange,
      platform: config.platform,
      metrics: config.metrics,
      template: config.template,
      result: result.success ? 'success' : 'failure'
    });
    
    return result.success;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to share environmental impact:', error);
    return false;
  }
}
```

## Integration Points
- **Related Features**: 
  - User profiles and achievements
  - Community challenges
  - Analytics dashboard
- **API Endpoints**: 
  - `GET /api/users/{id}/impact`: Retrieves user's environmental impact data
  - `POST /api/sharing/log`: Logs sharing activity for analytics
- **State Management**: 
  - Redux slice for environmental impact data
  - Local caching of frequently accessed metrics

## Performance Considerations
- **Optimization Techniques**: 
  - Pre-generated shareable images for common milestones
  - On-demand image generation for custom content
  - Image compression before sharing
- **Potential Bottlenecks**: 
  - Image generation for complex visualizations
  - Social media API rate limits
- **Battery/Resource Impact**: 
  - Minimal since sharing is an infrequent, user-initiated action
  - Image generation optimized to reduce CPU usage

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Impact calculation accuracy
  - Shareable content generation
  - Social platform integration
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - End-to-end sharing flow
  - Cross-platform image compatibility
  - Analytics tracking verification
- **Mock Data**: 
  - Sample impact metrics for different user profiles
  - Various achievement milestones
  - Social platform response scenarios

## Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: 
  - Tab focus for all sharing controls
  - Keyboard shortcuts for sharing actions
- **Screen Reader Compatibility**: 
  - ARIA labels for impact metrics
  - Alternative text for shareable images
- **Color Contrast**: 
  - High-contrast mode for impact visualizations
  - Text-based alternatives for color-coded metrics

## Future Improvements
- Add AR/VR visualizations of environmental impact
- Implement gamified sharing challenges and rewards
- Develop location-based impact comparisons (neighborhood, city)
- Create animated sharing templates for increased engagement
- Enable team/group aggregated impact sharing
