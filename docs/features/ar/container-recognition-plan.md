# AR Container Recognition Prototype Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for developing a prototype of the AR container recognition feature for EcoCart. This feature will allow users to scan recycling containers and receive information about their recyclability, materials, and environmental impact.

## Objectives

1. Implement basic AR functionality in the EcoCart app
2. Develop container recognition capabilities
3. Display contextual information about recognized containers
4. Create a user-friendly interface for the AR scanner
5. Test the prototype with common container types

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: React Native with Expo
- **AR Library**: 
  - Primary: ViroReact - A community-maintained AR/VR library for React Native
  - Alternative: Expo's AR modules that build on ARKit (iOS) and ARCore (Android)
- **Image Recognition**: ARKit/ARCore image detection with custom-trained models
- **3D Rendering**: Three.js for rendering 3D models and overlays
- **UI Components**: Custom UI components for AR interface

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Setup and Basic AR Integration (Week 2)

- Install and configure ViroReact or Expo AR modules
- Create a basic AR scene with camera access
- Implement basic plane detection for placing AR content
- Design a simple AR interface with camera view and controls

### Phase 2: Image Recognition Development (Week 3)

- Create a database of container images for recognition training
- Train image recognition models for common container types
- Implement container detection using AR markers
- Test recognition accuracy with different container types

### Phase 3: AR Interface and Information Display (Week 4)

- Design and implement AR overlays for recognized containers
- Create 3D models or markers to highlight containers
- Develop information cards with container details
- Implement visual feedback for successful recognition

### Phase 4: Integration with EcoCart Systems (Week 5)

- Connect AR module with EcoCart's materials database
- Implement sustainability scoring for recognized containers
- Add recycling instructions based on container type
- Create user flows for adding recognized items to collection

## Required Resources

- Reference images of common recycling containers
- 3D models for different container types
- Access to iOS and Android devices for testing
- ARKit/ARCore documentation and examples
- Design assets for AR interface elements

## Technical Approach

### Container Recognition Methods

1. **Marker-based Recognition**: 
   - Use distinct visual features of containers as markers
   - Train recognition models with multiple angles and lighting conditions

2. **Shape Recognition**:
   - Detect common container shapes (bottles, cans, boxes)
   - Use machine learning to classify container types

3. **Barcode/Label Recognition**:
   - Scan product barcodes or recycling symbols
   - Match against a database of known products

### AR Experience Flow

1. User opens the AR scanner in the EcoCart app
2. Camera activates and begins scanning for containers
3. When a container is recognized, AR overlay appears with:
   - Container type identification
   - Material composition
   - Recycling instructions
   - Environmental impact score
4. User can tap for more information or add to collection
5. Multiple containers can be recognized in the same session

## Initial Implementation

For the prototype, we'll start with a simplified version focusing on:

```tsx
// Basic AR Scene component structure
function ARContainerScanner() {
  const [recognizedContainers, setRecognizedContainers] = useState([]);
  
  const handleContainerRecognized = (container) => {
    setRecognizedContainers([...recognizedContainers, container]);
  };
  
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <ViroARSceneNavigator
        initialScene={{
          scene: ARScene,
        }}
        style={styles.arView}
      />
      <ARControls />
      <RecognitionResults containers={recognizedContainers} />
    </View>
  );
}

// AR Scene with recognition logic
function ARScene(props) {
  return (
    <ViroARScene onTrackingUpdated={onTrackingUpdated}>
      <ViroARImageMarker target="plasticBottle" onAnchorFound={handlePlasticBottleFound}>
        <ViroNode>
          <ViroText text="Plastic Bottle" scale={[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]} position={[0, 0.1, 0]} />
          <ViroAnimatedImage source={require('./assets/recycling-icon.gif')} />
        </ViroNode>
      </ViroARImageMarker>
      
      {/* Additional container markers */}
    </ViroARScene>
  );
}
```

## Testing Strategy

1. **Development Testing**:
   - Test with printed images of containers
   - Test with actual containers in controlled environments
   - Test with different lighting conditions and backgrounds

2. **User Testing**:
   - Conduct usability tests with a small group of users
   - Gather feedback on recognition accuracy and UI clarity
   - Iterate based on user feedback

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure recognition speed and accuracy
   - Test battery usage during AR sessions
   - Optimize for performance on different devices

## Success Metrics

- Recognition accuracy rate > 80% for common container types
- Average recognition time < 3 seconds
- Positive user feedback on usability and helpfulness
- Successful integration with EcoCart's existing systems

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Device compatibility issues | Test on multiple device types; create fallback experiences |
| Recognition accuracy challenges | Start with limited container types; increase training data |
| Performance issues on older devices | Optimize AR content; provide performance settings |
| User experience complexity | Create simple interface; provide clear instructions |

## Next Steps

1. Set up development environment with AR capabilities
2. Create sample container database for recognition training
3. Implement basic AR scanner interface
4. Begin development of recognition algorithms
5. Design information display for recognized containers
