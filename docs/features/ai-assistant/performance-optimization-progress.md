# AI Assistant Performance Optimization - Progress Tracking

This document tracks the progress of performance optimization efforts for the EcoCart AI Assistant feature.

## Phase 1: Measurement & Baseline âœ…

**Status**: Completed
**Period**: July 15-17, 2023

### Accomplishments

- âœ… Implemented `AIPerformanceMonitor` utility for collecting performance metrics
- âœ… Created `Instrumentation` utility for instrumenting code with performance tracking
- âœ… Added performance tracking to critical components:
  - AIOfflineCache
  - AIAssistantService
  - SimilarityUtils
  - AI Chat UI components
- âœ… Developed visualization screen for real-time performance data
- âœ… Established baseline measurements for key metrics:
  - Response time: ~850ms average
  - Cache lookup: ~120ms average
  - Memory usage: ~45MB peak
  - UI render time: ~65ms average

### Lessons Learned

- The similarity calculation was a significant bottleneck, taking up to 30% of response time
- Offline cache load time was excessive during cold starts (~600ms)
- FAQ matching had high latency due to unoptimized lookup algorithm
- Memory usage spikes occurred during batch operations

## Phase 2: Cache Optimization ðŸ”„

**Status**: In Progress
**Period**: July 18-22, 2023

### Accomplishments

- âœ… Replaced LRU implementation with optimized version:
  - Memory footprint reduced by ~30%
  - Lookup time improved by ~40%
- âœ… Implemented tiered caching strategy:
  - Memory cache for frequent items
  - Disk cache for less frequent items
  - Smarter eviction policies based on usage patterns
- âœ… Added indexing for faster lookup:
  - Query index for similarity matching
  - FAQ index for direct lookups
  - Category index for grouping related items
- âœ… Optimized similarity calculations:
  - Implemented early termination for non-matches
  - Added multi-algorithm strategy based on query length
- âœ… Created benchmarking utility:
  - Measures cache initialization time
  - Tests lookup performance
  - Analyzes similarity calculation efficiency
  - Evaluates response generation speed
- ðŸ”„ Working on memory optimization:
  - Reducing duplicate data storage
  - Implementing lazy loading for large datasets
  - Adding compression for disk cache

### Performance Improvements

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Cache Initialization | 600ms | 350ms | 42% |
| Cache Lookup (exact) | 120ms | 35ms | 71% |
| Cache Lookup (similar) | 230ms | 85ms | 63% |
| Memory Usage | 45MB | 32MB | 29% |
| FAQ Match Accuracy | 85% | 92% | 8% |
