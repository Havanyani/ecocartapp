## Technical Implementation Details

### Smart Bin Protocol

The smart bin integration follows a standardized BLE protocol with the following characteristics:

```
Service UUID: 0000XXXX-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
Characteristics:
- Weight: 00000001-...
- Fill Level: 00000002-...
- Battery: 00000003-...
- Lid Status: 00000004-...
- Material Detection: 00000005-...
- Settings: 00000006-...
```

Each characteristic is read periodically to monitor bin status and alert users when bins are full or when they detect specific recyclable materials.

### Energy Monitor Protocol

Energy monitors use a similar BLE protocol structure:

```
Service UUID: 0000EEXX-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
Characteristics:
- Power: 00000101-...
- Voltage: 00000102-...
- Current: 00000103-...
- Energy: 00000104-...
- Frequency: 00000105-...
- Power Factor: 00000106-...
- Settings: 00000109-...
```

These characteristics allow for comprehensive energy monitoring, including real-time power consumption, historical usage patterns, and efficiency analysis.

### Technical Challenges Overcome

1. **Device Discovery**: Created a robust device discovery system that can identify and categorize different types of smart devices
2. **Protocol Standardization**: Implemented a unified approach to device communication while supporting device-specific features
3. **Data Persistence**: Developed efficient storage mechanisms for device data and user settings
4. **Battery Optimization**: Minimized the impact of continuous monitoring on mobile device battery life

## Next Steps (Week 5)

The next phase will focus on:

   - Implement scheduling for device operations
   - Create condition-based triggers

3. **Data Analysis**
   - Enhance waste reduction recommendations
   - Improve energy saving suggestions
   - Develop sustainability scoring

## Conclusion

Week 4 has successfully delivered the core smart device integration components, establishing the foundation for comprehensive eco-home management. The implementation enables users to monitor and optimize their waste management and energy consumption patterns, directly contributing to the app's sustainability goals. Our adapters provide a scalable architecture that can be extended to additional device types in the future.
