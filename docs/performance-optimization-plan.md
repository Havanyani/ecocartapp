# EcoCart Performance Optimization Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for performance optimizations across all platforms (iOS, Android, Web) for the EcoCart application. It details completed work, current status, and future plans.

## Completed Implementations

### Cross-Platform Components
- ✅ **OptimizedImage**: Platform-specific image optimization
  - Web: Lazy loading, blur-up technique, WebP support
  - Mobile: Native caching, progressive loading, memory optimization
  
- ✅ **LazyScreen**: Deferred loading of non-critical screens
  - Web: Intersection Observer API, code splitting
  - Mobile: Dynamic imports, reduced initial bundle size
  
- ✅ **AppInitializer**: Platform-specific app initialization
  - Web: Service worker registration, web fonts, Core Web Vitals tracking
  - Mobile: Asset preloading, font loading, splash screen management

### Performance Monitoring
- ✅ **WebPerformanceMonitor**: Web-specific performance tracking
  - Core Web Vitals tracking (LCP, FID, CLS, TTFB, FCP)
  - Navigation timing metrics
  - Custom performance measurements

- ✅ **Performance Dashboard**: Visual performance data representation
  - Web vitals visualization
  - Performance score calculation
  - Recommendations for improvements

## Current Status
- Core performance components implemented
- Platform-specific optimizations in place for critical rendering paths
- Web performance monitoring system implemented
- Documentation and migration guides created

## Next Steps

### High Priority
1. **Performance Testing Infrastructure**
   - Create automated performance regression tests
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline for performance testing
   - Set up alerting for performance regressions

2. **Asset Optimization Pipeline**
   - Implement automated image optimization in build process
   - Add responsive image generation
   - Create font subsetting and optimization

### Medium Priority
1. **Progressive Web App (PWA) Features**
   - Complete service worker implementation
   - Add offline support
   - Implement background sync for data operations

2. **Advanced Caching Strategies**
   - Implement stale-while-revalidate pattern
   - Create cache invalidation strategies
   - Optimize API response caching

### Low Priority
1. **Code Splitting Refinement**
   - Analyze bundle sizes and dependencies
   - Implement route-based code splitting
   - Create vendor chunk optimization
