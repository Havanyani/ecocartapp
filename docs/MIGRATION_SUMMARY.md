# Migration to Extension-Based Structure

This document summarizes the progress of the migration to an extension-based structure for cross-platform development.

## Completed Work

### 1. Documentation
- Created `docs/MIGRATION.md` detailing migration strategy
- Updated `src/ARCHITECTURE.md` with extension pattern details
- Created component standards guide
- Created responsive layout system documentation
- Created web routing documentation
- Created project structure documentation

### 2. Utilities
- Enhanced `src/utils/styleUtils.ts` with:
  - `createResponsiveStyles()` function
  - `platformSelect()` utility
  - `useScreenDimensions()` hook
- Created platform-specific module mocks
- Created SEO utilities for web
- Created web-specific navigation utilities

### 3. Component Migration
- Button component: native and web implementations
- Card component: native and web implementations 
- OptimizedImage component: native and web implementations
- TextField component: native and web implementations
- Modal component: native and web implementations
- List component: native and web implementations
- BottomSheet component: native and web implementations
- Navigation components: Router and NavigationLink with platform-specific implementations
- Comprehensive READMEs for each component

### 4. Web Module Mocks
- Created haptic feedback mock for web
- Updated `package.json` browser field

### 5. Testing Matrix
- Established platform-specific test setup
- Created test utilities for cross-platform components

## Future Enhancements

While the migration to the extension-based structure is complete, here are some potential enhancements for the future:

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Further optimize bundle size for web
   - Implement code splitting for large components

2. **Developer Experience**
   - Create code generators for new components
   - Enhance testing utilities with more helpers

3. **Accessibility**
   - Enhance accessibility support across platforms
   - Create accessibility testing utilities

4. **Documentation**
   - Create storybook documentation for components
   - Add more examples to component READMEs
