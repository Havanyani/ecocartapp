## Technical Highlights

### Battery-Aware Real-Time Updates
The implementation includes a sophisticated battery optimization system that dynamically adjusts update frequencies and location accuracy based on the device's battery state:

```typescript
// Battery state to update interval mapping (in milliseconds)
const BATTERY_STATE_INTERVALS = {
  UNPLUGGED: {
    normal: 30000, // 30 seconds
    low: 60000, // 1 minute
    critical: 180000, // 3 minutes
  },
  CHARGING: {
    normal: 10000, // 10 seconds
    low: 15000, // 15 seconds
    critical: 30000, // 30 seconds
  },
  FULL: {
    normal: 5000, // 5 seconds
    low: 10000, // 10 seconds
    critical: 15000, // 15 seconds
  },
};
```

### Notification History Service
Created a robust notification history system with sophisticated filtering capabilities:

```typescript
// Get notification history with filters
const notifications = await notificationHistoryService.getInstance().getHistory({
  type: 'delivery_status',
  read: false,
  startDate: new Date(Date.now() - 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000), // Last 7 days
});
```

### Battery-Optimized Location Tracking
Implemented location tracking that automatically adjusts accuracy based on battery level:

```typescript
// Get location accuracy settings based on battery state
const accuracySettings = batteryOptimizer.getLocationAccuracySettings();
// { accuracy: 4, distanceInterval: 10, timeInterval: 20000 }
```

## Architecture and Design Patterns

The implementation follows several key design patterns:

1. **Singleton Pattern**: Used for service instances like BatteryOptimizer and NotificationHistoryService
2. **Observer Pattern**: Implemented with listeners for battery state changes and WebSocket events
3. **Factory Pattern**: Used for creating notifications with consistent structure
4. **Strategy Pattern**: Applied for different battery optimization strategies based on device state
5. **Repository Pattern**: Used for notification history data access
6. **Adapter Pattern**: Implemented for WebSocket service to abstract connection details

## Testing Approach

The testing strategy for real-time features includes:

1. **Unit Tests**: For individual components and utilities
2. **Integration Tests**: For testing the interaction between components
3. **Performance Tests**: For measuring the impact on battery, memory, and network usage
4. **Mock Services**: For simulating WebSocket connections and battery state changes

## Conclusion

The implementation provides a complete solution for real-time updates in the EcoCart application, with a strong focus on battery optimization and user experience. The features enable users to stay informed about their collections and delivery personnel while ensuring the application remains efficient and does not drain device resources.

The modular architecture allows for easy extension and maintenance, with clear separation of concerns between different components. The comprehensive testing ensures the reliability and performance of the real-time features across different devices and usage scenarios.
