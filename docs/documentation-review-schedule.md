## Review Process

Each review should follow this standard process:

1. **Pre-Review Preparation (T-1 week)**:
   - Documentation owner runs automated document checks
   - Documentation owner reviews changes since last review
   - Documentation owner identifies areas for improvement
   - Documentation owner shares pre-review report with reviewers

2. **Review Meeting**:
   - Review documentation against the [Documentation Review Checklist](./documentation-review-checklist.md)
   - Identify issues and areas for improvement
   - Assign action items with due dates
   - Schedule follow-up if necessary

3. **Post-Review Actions (T+1 week)**:
   - Documentation owner implements agreed changes
   - Reviewers verify changes
   - Documentation owner updates review status and next review date

## Automated Pre-Review Checks

Before each review, documentation owners should run the following automated checks:

1. **Markdown Linting**: Using `markdownlint` to check formatting
2. **Link Checker**: Using `link-checker` to verify links are valid
3. **Spelling Check**: Using `cspell` to catch spelling errors
4. **Reading Level**: Using `readability` to ensure appropriate language level
5. **Code Example Validation**: Using `code-example-validator` to verify examples

## Documentation Review Tracking

All documentation reviews will be tracked in the Documentation Reviews Tracker:

```
/docs/reviews/review-tracker.csv
```

The tracker includes:
- Document path
- Last review date
- Reviewers
- Status (Passed/Failed/Needs Improvement)
- Action items
- Due dates
- Next review date

## Metrics

The following metrics will be tracked for documentation reviews:

1. **Review Completion Rate**: Percentage of scheduled reviews completed
2. **Issue Resolution Rate**: Percentage of identified issues resolved
3. **Time to Resolution**: Average time to resolve identified issues
4. **Review Cycle Time**: Time between successive reviews
5. **Documentation Quality Score**: Percentage compliance with checklist items

These metrics will be reported quarterly to measure the effectiveness of the review process.

## Continuous Improvement

The documentation review process itself will be evaluated at each quarterly review to identify opportunities for improvement. Specific attention will be given to:

1. Review frequency adjustments
2. Automation opportunities
3. Checklist refinements
4. Process simplification
5. Integration with development workflow

## Emergency Reviews

For urgent documentation issues (security vulnerabilities, critical bugs, etc.), an expedited review process is available:

1. Issue reporter contacts documentation owner directly
2. Documentation owner schedules ad-hoc review within 24 hours
3. Critical fixes are implemented within 48 hours
4. Emergency review is logged in the tracking system

## Resources

Documentation owners and reviewers should be familiar with:

1. [Documentation Review Checklist](./documentation-review-checklist.md)
2. [Documentation Ownership](./documentation-ownership.md)
3. [Documentation Templates](./templates/)
4. [Documentation Maintenance Process](./documentation-maintenance-process.md)

## Review Schedule Updates

This review schedule will be updated quarterly or as needed based on project changes. The documentation lead is responsible for maintaining this schedule.
