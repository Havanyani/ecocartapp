# Material Collection Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview
The Material Collection Feature is a core functionality of the EcoCart app, allowing users to browse recyclable materials, identify materials through barcode scanning, and schedule collection of these materials. This feature aims to promote recycling by making it easy for users to understand what materials can be recycled and how to properly dispose of them.

## Current Status
Through our investigation, we found the following components already implemented:
- Material API and data model
- MaterialListScreen for browsing materials
- BarcodeScannerScreen for identifying materials
- Basic collection screens (CollectionListScreen)

  - Implement AR-based volume estimation for containers
  - Add predefined weights for common items
  - Implement calculation of potential rewards based on weight
  - Add gamification elements for weight milestones

### 6. Collection History and Tracking
- **Status**: Basic structure exists
- **Description**: Enhance the history and tracking of material collections.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement detailed collection history view
  - Add status tracking for scheduled collections
  - Create a summary view with environmental impact statistics
  - Implement reward history and tracking
  - Add filtering and search options for past collections

### 7. Notifications for Collections
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Description**: Add notification support for collection-related events.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement reminder notifications for scheduled collections
  - Add status update notifications
  - Create custom notification preferences for collection events
  - Implement promotional notifications for recycling campaigns

## Technical Components to Build

### 1. Components
- **MaterialCategorySelector**: Visual selector for material categories
- **MaterialWeightEstimator**: Component for estimating material weight
- **CollectionSchedulerForm**: Form for scheduling collection
- **RecyclingImpactCard**: Visual display of environmental impact
- **MaterialActionButtons**: Reusable action buttons for material-related actions
- **CollectionStatusIndicator**: Visual indicator for collection status

### 2. Screens
- **MaterialCollectionFormScreen**: Screen for scheduling collection
- **MaterialWeightEstimationScreen**: Screen for estimating material weight
- **CollectionDetailScreen**: Screen for viewing collection details
- **CollectionHistoryScreen**: Enhanced screen for viewing collection history
- **MaterialScanResultScreen**: Enhanced screen for displaying scan results

### 3. Services and APIs
- **CollectionSchedulingApi**: API for scheduling collections
- **WeightEstimationService**: Service for estimating material weights
- **NotificationService**: Service for handling collection notifications
- **ImpactCalculationService**: Service for calculating environmental impact

## Integration Points
- Connect material browsing with collection scheduling
- Integrate barcode scanning with material collection
- Link material details with weight estimation
- Connect collection scheduling with notification system

## Testing Strategy
