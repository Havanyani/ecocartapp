# EcoCart Documentation Maintenance Process

This document outlines the processes and responsibilities for maintaining the EcoCart application documentation.

## Documentation Lifecycle

### 1. Creation
- **When to Create Documentation**: Documentation should be created alongside new features, components, or significant code changes
- **Templates to Use**: 
  - [Feature Documentation Template](./templates/feature-documentation-template.md) for features
  - [Component README Template](./templates/component-readme-template.md) for components
- **Responsibility**: The developer implementing the feature/component is responsible for creating the initial documentation

### 2. Review
- **Review Process**: Documentation should be reviewed as part of the code review process
- **Review Criteria**:
  - Completeness: Covers all aspects of the feature/component
  - Accuracy: Correctly describes functionality and implementation
  - Clarity: Written in clear, concise language
  - Consistency: Follows established templates and standards
  - Cross-references: Includes appropriate links to related documentation
- **Responsibility**: Code reviewers are responsible for reviewing documentation changes

### 3. Maintenance
- **Regular Updates**: Documentation should be updated whenever the associated code changes
- **Scheduled Reviews**: Documentation should be reviewed comprehensively on a bi-weekly basis
- **Version Synchronization**: Documentation version should match the application version it describes

### 4. Archiving
- **Deprecation Process**: When features are deprecated, their documentation should be marked as deprecated
- **Archival Process**: When features are removed, their documentation should be archived rather than deleted
- **Historical Reference**: Archived documentation should be maintained for historical reference

## Documentation Review Checklist

Use this checklist when reviewing documentation:

### General

### Feature Documentation
- [ ] Overview clearly explains the feature's purpose
- [ ] User-facing functionality is thoroughly described
- [ ] Technical implementation details are accurate
- [ ] Architecture and design patterns are explained
- [ ] Integration points are clearly identified
- [ ] Performance considerations are addressed
- [ ] Testing approach is documented
- [ ] Accessibility considerations are included
- [ ] Future improvements are outlined

### Component Documentation
- [ ] Usage examples are provided and correct
- [ ] Props are completely and accurately documented
- [ ] Features and limitations are clearly described
- [ ] Styling options are explained
- [ ] Best practices are provided
- [ ] Examples cover common use cases
- [ ] Internal structure is explained at an appropriate level
- [ ] Dependencies are noted

## Bi-Weekly Documentation Review

The bi-weekly documentation review process includes:

1. **Scope Review**: Identify documentation gaps for recent feature additions
2. **Content Audit**: Verify accuracy of existing documentation
3. **Link Validation**: Ensure all cross-references are valid
4. **Consistency Check**: Verify adherence to templates and standards
5. **User Feedback Review**: Consider user feedback on documentation clarity

## Documentation Ownership

### Core Documentation Owners
- **Feature Documentation**: Feature team leads
- **Component Documentation**: UI/UX team lead
- **Architecture Documentation**: Lead architect
- **API Documentation**: Backend team lead
- **User Documentation**: Product team lead

### Responsibilities of Documentation Owners
- Ensure documentation is created for new developments
- Review documentation changes in their area
- Schedule and lead bi-weekly documentation reviews
- Identify and address documentation gaps
- Train team members on documentation practices

## Documentation in the Development Process

Documentation should be integrated into the development process:

1. **Planning**: Include documentation requirements in feature/component planning
2. **Implementation**: Create or update documentation alongside code changes
3. **Review**: Review documentation as part of the code review process
4. **Release**: Include documentation updates in release notes
5. **Maintenance**: Update documentation as part of bug fixes and enhancements

## Documentation Standards Enforcement

To ensure consistent documentation quality:

1. **Automated Checks**: Implement automated checks for documentation format and presence
2. **Pull Request Requirements**: Require documentation updates in pull request descriptions
3. **Review Guidelines**: Include documentation review in code review guidelines
4. **Training**: Provide training on documentation best practices for all team members

## Conclusion

Maintaining high-quality documentation is critical for the success of the EcoCart application. By following this maintenance process, we ensure that our documentation remains accurate, comprehensive, and useful for both developers and users.
