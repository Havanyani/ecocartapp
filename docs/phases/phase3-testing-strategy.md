# Phase 3: Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the EcoCart application during Phase 3 of development. The strategy focuses on internal testing, feedback collection, and ensuring cross-platform compatibility.

## Testing Objectives

1. **Functionality Verification**: Ensure all features work as expected across platforms
2. **User Experience Validation**: Verify that the app provides a smooth, intuitive experience
3. **Performance Benchmarking**: Establish baseline performance metrics for future optimization
4. **Bug Identification**: Identify and document issues for resolution
5. **Platform-Specific Testing**: Address platform-specific behaviors and requirements

## Testing Approach

### 1. Unit Testing

- **Framework**: Jest with React Native Testing Library
- **Coverage Target**: 80% code coverage for critical components
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Component rendering and behavior
  - State management
  - Utility functions
  - API integration

### 2. Integration Testing

- **Framework**: Detox for end-to-end testing
- **Coverage Target**: Key user flows and critical paths
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Navigation flows
  - Data persistence
  - API interactions
  - Cross-component communication

### 3. Manual Testing

- **Platforms**: iOS, Android, and Web
- **Devices**: Various screen sizes and OS versions
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Visual consistency
  - Gesture handling
  - Platform-specific behaviors
  - Accessibility compliance

### 4. Performance Testing

- **Tools**: React Native Performance Monitor, Chrome DevTools
- **Metrics**:
  - App launch time
  - Screen render time
  - Memory usage
  - Network request latency
  - Animation frame rate

## Testing Environments

### Development

- Local development environment
- Mock API responses
- Simulated data

### Staging

- Staging server with test data
- Integration with test APIs
- Controlled environment for reproducible testing

### Production (Beta)

- Limited user testing
- Real-world conditions
- Production APIs with test accounts

## Testing Schedule

1. **Week 1**: Unit and integration test implementation
2. **Week 2**: Manual testing and bug fixing
3. **Week 3**: Performance testing and optimization
4. **Week 4**: Beta testing and feedback collection

## Bug Tracking and Resolution

- **Tracking System**: GitHub Issues
- **Severity Levels**:
  - Critical: Blocking functionality, data loss
  - High: Major feature not working
  - Medium: Feature partially working or with workarounds
  - Low: Minor issues, UI inconsistencies
- **Resolution Process**:
  1. Bug reported and categorized
  2. Assigned to developer
  3. Fixed and verified
  4. Regression testing
  5. Closed

## Feedback Collection

- **Methods**:
  - In-app feedback forms
  - User interviews
  - Analytics data
  - Crash reports
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Usability
  - Performance
  - Feature completeness
  - Platform-specific issues

## Documentation Requirements

- Test plans for each feature
- Test results and metrics
- Known issues and workarounds
- Platform-specific considerations
- Performance benchmarks

## Success Criteria

- All critical and high-priority bugs resolved
- Performance metrics meet or exceed targets
- User feedback indicates positive experience
- Cross-platform compatibility verified
- Documentation complete and accurate
