# Error Boundary Improvements in EcoCart

This document outlines the improvements made to the error handling system in the EcoCart application, focusing on the consolidation of error boundaries and fixes for bundling issues.

## Consolidated Error Boundary

We've created a unified error boundary implementation (`ConsolidatedErrorBoundary`) that replaces multiple redundant implementations found across the codebase. This consolidation ensures:

1. **Consistent User Experience**: All errors are presented to users in a standardized, user-friendly format.
2. **Centralized Error Tracking**: All React errors are logged to the performance monitoring system.
3. **Improved Error Recovery**: The boundary includes reset functionality and try-again capabilities.
4. **Enhanced Context**: Errors are reported with component names and stack traces for easier debugging.

### Usage Example

```tsx
import { ErrorBoundary } from '@/components/error';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary componentName="ProductList">
      {/* Your component content */}
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}
```

## Bundling Fixes

We encountered and resolved several bundling issues related to the performance monitoring system:

1. **Dynamic Imports**: Replaced static imports with dynamic `require()` calls wrapped in try/catch blocks to handle cases where modules might not be available.

2. **Fallback Implementations**: Created fallback implementations for critical services to ensure the app continues to function even if specific modules fail to load.

3. **Simplified Dependencies**: Removed or simplified complex dependencies that were causing bundling issues.

4. **Safe Error Tracking**: Modified the error boundary to handle cases where performance monitoring might not be available.

### Key Changes

```tsx
// Dynamic import with fallback
let performanceMonitor: any;
try {
  const { performanceMonitor: pm } = require('@/services/PerformanceMonitorService');
  performanceMonitor = pm;
} catch (e) {
  console.warn('Performance monitoring not available:', e);
  performanceMonitor = {
    captureError: (error: Error, metadata?: any) => {
      console.error('Error captured (no monitoring):', error, metadata);
    }
  };
}
```

## Performance Monitoring Improvements

The performance monitoring system was enhanced to:

1. **Avoid Network Dependencies**: Initialization now happens in two phases, with network operations deferred until after UI rendering.

2. **Handle Timeouts**: Added timeout protection to prevent hanging during startup.

3. **Handle Missing Dependencies**: Created stub implementations for scenarios where dependencies might be missing.

4. **Use Singleton Pattern**: Implemented a singleton pattern with static delegation methods for backward compatibility.

## Test Environment

To verify the improvements, we created a minimal test environment that demonstrates the key functionality:

1. **Test App**: A simplified application that focuses solely on the error boundary functionality.

2. **Error Thrower**: A component that deliberately throws errors when triggered by user interaction.

3. **Isolation**: The test environment isolates the core functionality from complex initialization processes that might introduce additional errors.

## Future Work

While the current implementation addresses immediate issues, further improvements could include:

1. **More Detailed Error Information**: Enhance the error display with more contextual information.

2. **Automatic Retry Logic**: Add intelligent retry mechanisms for recoverable errors.

3. **Error Categorization**: Categorize errors to provide more specific recovery options.

4. **Offline Error Queuing**: Store errors that occur offline and report them when connectivity is restored.

## Conclusion

These improvements enhance the stability and reliability of the EcoCart application by providing robust error handling that works consistently across platforms and bundling environments. The consolidated error boundary approach simplifies maintenance while improving the user experience when errors occur.
