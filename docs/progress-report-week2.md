# Week 2 Progress Report - EcoCart Project

## Summary
Week 2 focused on setting up the CI/CD pipeline, preparing for app store submission, and beginning work on the AR container recognition prototype. We have established a foundation for automated testing, building, and deployment while also making significant progress on the AR feature.

## Task Completion Status

| Task | Priority | Completion % | Notes |
|------|----------|--------------|-------|
| App store submission preparation | High | 100% | Created all required assets, scripts, and documentation |
| CI pipeline basics setup | High | 100% | GitHub Actions workflow created with comprehensive CI/CD setup |
| AR container recognition prototype | Medium | 70% | Core components implemented with simulated recognition |
| Testing coverage enhancement | Medium | 0% | Not started yet |

**Overall Completion**: 67.5%

## Detailed Progress

### App Store Submission Preparation (100% Complete)
- Created app store assets for icons and screenshots
- Implemented scripts for generating required icon sizes
- Prepared deployment guide and privacy policy template
- Set up build profiles for production releases

### CI Pipeline Setup (100% Complete)
- Implemented GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and deployment
- Created build profiles for development, preview, and production
- Added automated testing, linting, and TypeScript checking
- Set up OTA updates and app store submission automation
- Added comprehensive documentation and developer tools

### AR Container Recognition Prototype (70% Complete)
- Created the core AR container scanner component with camera integration
- Implemented container recognition simulation for prototype testing
- Added visual guidance overlay for better user experience
- Developed detailed container information display with recycling status
- Created environmental impact calculation component
- Set up navigation and screen integration
- Established reusable component structure for future enhancements
- Still pending: Integration with ARKit/ARCore for real recognition capability

### Testing Coverage Enhancement (0% Complete)
- Not started yet, planned for the end of Week 2 or beginning of Week 3

## Key Achievements
- Established a mature CI/CD pipeline for the project
- Automated the deployment process for better developer experience
- Implemented the foundation for AR container recognition feature
- Created comprehensive component structure for future AR development

## Challenges
- Ensuring team members have proper permissions for the CI/CD pipeline
- Coordinating naming conventions across different platforms
- Simulating AR recognition capability while waiting for real implementation

## Next Steps
- Complete the AR container recognition prototype with ARKit/ARCore integration
- Begin enhancing testing coverage across the application
- Conduct user testing of the AR feature

## Resources Needed
- Access to Expo tokens and developer accounts for testing
- Additional testing devices for AR functionality validation

## Conclusion
Week 2 has been productive with significant progress made on our CI/CD pipeline and the beginning of our AR feature implementation. The team is well-positioned to move forward with the remaining tasks and deliver a robust recycling container recognition feature for our users.
