# AI Assistant Feature

## Overview

The AI Assistant feature provides EcoCart users with an intelligent, context-aware assistant to help with sustainability questions, recycling information, and eco-friendly recommendations. This feature is designed to enhance user engagement and provide personalized support for making environmentally conscious decisions.

## Current Status

**This feature is currently in planning/early implementation phase.**

The AI Assistant framework has been established with the following components:

- Core service layer (`AIAssistantService`)
- React context provider (`AIAssistantProvider`)
- Basic chat UI component (`AIAssistantChat`)

However, the actual AI integration is not yet implemented and currently uses mock responses.

## Planned Functionality

The AI Assistant is intended to provide:

- **Recycling Guidance**: Answering questions about how to recycle specific items
- **Sustainability Tips**: Offering personalized eco-friendly recommendations
- **Product Information**: Providing details about the environmental impact of products
- **General Knowledge**: Answering questions about sustainability topics
- **Contextual Awareness**: Remembering conversation history for coherent interactions

## Technical Implementation

### Service Architecture

- **Service Pattern**: Singleton pattern implementation via `AIAssistantService`
- **State Management**: React Context API with the `AIAssistantProvider`
- **UI Components**: Reusable chat interface in `AIAssistantChat`

### Data Flow

1. User interacts with the chat interface
2. Queries are processed by the AI service
3. Responses are delivered back to the UI
4. Conversation history is maintained for context

### Planned AI Integration Options

- **OpenAI API**: For cloud-based processing (requires API key and internet connection)
- **TensorFlow.js**: For on-device processing (better privacy, works offline)
- **Custom API**: EcoCart-specific endpoint for tailored responses

## Roadmap for Completion

1. **Service Integration**
   - Implement actual AI service connection
   - Add proper error handling and retry logic
   - Implement caching for common questions

2. **Enhanced UI**
   - Optimize chat interface for different screen sizes
   - Add voice input/output capabilities
   - Implement animations for a more engaging experience

3. **Feature Integration**
   - Connect with camera/AR features for object recognition
   - Integrate with user profile for personalized responses
   - Link to product database for specific product questions

4. **Testing & Refinement**
   - Conduct usability testing
   - Optimize performance
   - Refine response quality

## Getting Started (For Developers)

To work with the AI Assistant feature in its current state:

```tsx
// Import the provider
import AIAssistantProvider from '@/providers/AIAssistantProvider';
import { AIAssistantChat } from '@/components/ai/AIAssistantChat';

// Wrap your component with the provider
function MyApp() {
  return (
    <AIAssistantProvider>
      <MyAppContent />
    </AIAssistantProvider>
  );
}

// Use the chat component where needed
function ChatScreen() {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <AIAssistantChat 
        showHeader={true}
        initialMessage="Tell me about recycling plastic"
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

## Configuration Options

The AI Assistant service can be configured with these options:

```typescript
const config = {
  apiEndpoint: 'https://your-custom-endpoint.com/assistant',
  useLocalProcessing: true, // Use on-device processing when possible
  maxHistoryLength: 50, // Maximum number of messages to keep in history
  defaultGreeting: 'Hello! How can I help you be more eco-friendly today?'
};

<AIAssistantProvider config={config}>
  {/* Your app content */}
</AIAssistantProvider>
```

## Known Limitations

- Currently uses mock responses instead of real AI integration
- Limited to text-based interactions (voice and image recognition planned)
- No persistent storage for conversation history between sessions

## Future Enhancements

- Voice interaction
- Image recognition for recyclable items
- Integration with smart home devices
- Personalized eco-tips based on user behavior
- Multi-language support
