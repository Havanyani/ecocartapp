## Memoization Utilities

The EcoCart app includes powerful memoization utilities to prevent unnecessary re-renders and optimize computation. These utilities are located in `src/utils/memoization.ts`.

### useMemoizedCallback

A enhanced version of React's `useCallback` that provides performance tracking:

```typescript
const handlePress = useMemoizedCallback(
  (itemId: string) => {
    // Handle item press logic
  },
  [dependencies],
  { 
    trackPerformance: true, 
    componentName: 'ProductList', 
    functionName: 'handlePress' 
  }
);
```

### useStableObject

Creates a stable object reference that only changes when the object's properties change:

```typescript
const options = useStableObject({
  id: item.id,
  price: item.price,
  quantity: quantity
});
```

### createMemoizedComponent

Creates a memoized component with performance tracking:

```typescript
const MemoizedProductCard = createMemoizedComponent(
  ProductCard,
  {
    trackPerformance: __DEV__,
    componentName: 'ProductCard',
    areEqual: (prevProps, nextProps) => {
      return prevProps.id === nextProps.id && prevProps.price === nextProps.price;
    }
  }
);
```

## Optimized List Components

The EcoCart app includes optimized list components that provide superior performance for rendering large lists of data.

### OptimizedListView

Located in `src/components/performance/OptimizedListView.tsx`, this component provides:

- Automatic performance tracking
- Memoized rendering functions
- Optimized FlatList configuration
- Efficient loading and empty states

Usage example:

```tsx
<OptimizedListView
  data={products}
  renderItem={(item, index) => <ProductCard product={item} />}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  isLoading={isLoading}
  trackPerformance={true}
  componentId="ProductList"
/>
```

### OptimizedVirtualizedList

Located in `src/components/performance/OptimizedVirtualizedList.tsx`, this component provides:

- View recycling for memory efficiency
- Auto-adjusting optimization parameters based on performance
- Smart batching for render performance
- Memory usage optimization for large lists

Usage example:

```tsx
<OptimizedVirtualizedList
  data={products}
  getItemCount={(data) => data.length}
  getItem={(data, index) => data[index]}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <ProductCard product={item} />}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  isLoading={isLoading}
  estimatedItemSize={120}
  listId="ProductVirtualizedList"
  autoOptimize={true}
/>
```

### useListPerformance Hook

Located in `src/hooks/useListPerformance.ts`, this custom hook provides:

- Performance metrics for lists
- Optimized configuration recommendations
- Automatic tracking of render times
- Memory usage optimization

Usage example:

```tsx
const { 
  metrics, 
  optimizedProps, 
  trackItemRender, 
  trackListRender 
} = useListPerformance({
  listId: 'product-list',
  itemCount: products.length,
  trackPerformance: true
});
```

## Performance Monitoring

The EcoCart app includes a performance monitoring system to track and analyze performance metrics.

### PerformanceMonitoring Utility

Located in `src/utils/PerformanceMonitoring.ts`, this utility provides:

- Recording of performance metrics
- Categories for different types of operations
- Integration with analytics in production

Usage example:

```typescript
PerformanceMonitor.recordMetric({
  name: 'product_list_render',
  duration: renderTime,
  type: 'render',
  component: 'ProductList',
  timestamp: Date.now()
});
```

To view performance metrics in development:

1. Open the Developer Menu (shake device or press `Cmd+D` in simulator)
2. Tap "Toggle Performance Monitor"

## Best Practices

Follow these best practices to ensure optimal performance in the EcoCart app:

### General

- Use memoization utilities for callbacks and components that render frequently
- Avoid anonymous functions in render methods
- Keep component state as minimal as possible
- Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` for dependencies in hooks

### Lists and Data

- Use optimized list components for large datasets
- Implement pagination for API requests with large result sets
- Avoid complex calculations in render methods
- Use `shallowEqual` for comparing objects in memoization checks

### Navigation and Animation

- Use native driver for animations when possible
- Avoid complex animations during navigation transitions
- Defer non-critical work after navigation completes using `InteractionManager`

### Images

- Use `OptimizedImage` component from `src/components/OptimizedImage.tsx`
- Specify image dimensions to avoid layout shifts
- Use appropriate image resolutions for device screens

## Troubleshooting Performance Issues

If you encounter performance issues, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Problem**:
   - Use the Performance Monitor to identify slow components or operations
   - Check for unnecessary re-renders using the React DevTools Profiler
   - Look for long-running operations in the JavaScript thread

2. **Common Solutions**:
   - Implement memoization for frequently rendered components
   - Convert regular components to optimized list components
   - Apply code splitting for large screens or components
   - Optimize image loading and caching

3. **Advanced Techniques**:
   - Use `useListPerformance` hook to optimize list rendering
   - Consider moving complex calculations to a Web Worker
   - Implement virtualization for very large lists
   - Apply incremental rendering for complex UI

4. **Measuring Improvements**:
   - Take baseline measurements before making changes
   - Compare metrics after implementing optimizations
   - Test on both high-end and low-end devices

## Conclusion

Performance optimization is an ongoing process. Regularly review and profile the app to identify areas for improvement. The utilities and components described in this guide provide a foundation for maintaining excellent performance in the EcoCart app.
