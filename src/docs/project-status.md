- Comprehensive documentation in `src/docs/authentication-guide.md`

## Proposed Next Implementation Tasks

Based on the current project status, here are the recommended next implementation tasks in order of priority:

### 1. Offline Capabilities

**Goal**: Ensure app functionality during network interruptions.

**Suggested Tasks**:
- Implement offline data persistence with AsyncStorage or a more robust solution
- Add queue system for operations during offline mode
- Create offline sync mechanism for data reconciliation
- Implement background sync when the app returns online
- Add visual indicators for offline status

### 2. Material Collection Feature

**Goal**: Implement the core material collection feature of the app.

**Suggested Tasks**:
- Build material browsing and search screens
- Create material detail view with eco-impact information
- Implement barcode scanning for material identification
- Add material collection scheduling functionality
- Implement gamification elements for collection activities

### 3. Notifications and Reminders

**Goal**: Create a comprehensive notification system.

**Suggested Tasks**:
- Set up push notification infrastructure
- Implement in-app notification center
- Create notification preferences management
- Add scheduled local notifications for collection reminders
- Implement deep linking from notifications to relevant app screens

## Technical Debt and Improvements

While implementing new features, the following improvements should be considered:

1. **Code organization**: Review and refine the project structure for better maintainability
2. **Documentation**: Ensure comprehensive documentation for all major components
3. **Accessibility**: Conduct a thorough accessibility audit and implement improvements
4. **Performance monitoring**: Set up production monitoring for performance metrics
5. **Error tracking**: Integrate error tracking solution for production environment

## Conclusion

The EcoCart application has a solid foundation with completed navigation, performance optimization, testing infrastructure, data management, and authentication systems. The focus should now shift to implementing the core business features, starting with offline capabilities.

The proposed next steps aim to deliver the highest business value while maintaining the technical excellence established in the completed features. Regular reviews of the project status will help adjust priorities as development progresses.
