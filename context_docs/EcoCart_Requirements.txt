EcoCart - Integrating grocery delivery with plastic waste collection:
To establish a waste management business that will provide recycling rewards to shoppers, integrated with home grocery deliveries. 
The plan is to intercept waste (plastic, electronics etc) at the household. Since a lot of waste comes from households, in the business model of EcoCart deliverers of grocery will collect waste plastic from homes on their return leg to the grocery store, for delivery to collection depots at the various grocery stores, in exchange for which a shopper will receive credit on subsequent purchases in their shopping account. The credit will be calculated on the basis of the weight of waste of each category delivered from the shopper's address.
This business model will not be selling anything, at least not in the beginning, but buying waste under the rewards system. Whatever Product Catalog and Payments System that may be created in the app will likely be dormant until EcoCart start to sell something. EcoCart will be paying the grocery store for the discounts that shoppers will get on their purchases as it will be the buyer of the waste.
EcoCart will propose this functionality for API integration with grocery stores that have existing home grocery delivery services managed from a mobile app, such as CheckersSixty60 (As referenced at @CheckersSixty60_1).
