2. Complete the testing for offline conflict resolution
3. Begin work on AR container recognition features
4. Start planning for smart home device integration 

## Integration Strategy Implementation

Here's how to implement the integration strategy for your real-time notification system and other components:

## Day by Day Progress Tracking

1. **Setup Daily Standups**:
   - Schedule 15-minute daily standups at a consistent time (typically morning)
   - Use a structured format: what was completed yesterday, what's planned today, and any blockers
   - Track completed tasks in a shared document or task management tool

2. **Progress Board**:
   ```
   $ mkdir -p project-management/daily-standups
   $ touch project-management/daily-standups/standup-template.md
   ```

3. **Create a Standup Template**:
   ```markdown
   # Daily Standup - [DATE]
   
   ## Completed Yesterday
   - [ ] Task 1
   - [ ] Task 2
   
   ## Planned Today
   - [ ] Task 1
   - [ ] Task 2
   
   ## Blockers
   - None
   
   ## Notes
   ```

## Component Reusability

1. **Extract Shared Components**:
   ```typescript
   // Create a LocationTracker component that can be used in both route optimization and delivery tracking
   $ mkdir -p components/shared
   $ touch components/shared/LocationTracker.tsx
   ```

2. **Implement Adapter Pattern**:
   ```typescript
   // Create adapters for the route optimization dashboard components
   import { RouteMap } from '@/components/route-optimization/RouteMap';
   
   // Adapter to use RouteMap for delivery tracking
   export const DeliveryTrackingMap = (props) => {
     // Transform delivery tracking data to route data format
     const routeData = transformDeliveryToRouteFormat(props.deliveryData);
     
     // Use the RouteMap component with transformed data
     return <RouteMap data={routeData} {...props} />;
   };
   ```

3. **Create Shared Services**:
   - Refactor WebSocketService to be usable by both notification and real-time tracking systems
   - Create shared utilities for formatting, data handling, etc.

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests Structure**:
   ```
   $ mkdir -p __tests__/services
   $ mkdir -p __tests__/components
   $ touch __tests__/services/NotificationService.test.ts
   $ touch __tests__/services/WebSocketService.test.ts
   ```

2. **Test Implementation**:
   ```typescript
   // Example test for NotificationService
   import NotificationService from '@/src/services/NotificationService';
   
   describe('NotificationService', () => {
     beforeEach(() => {
       // Setup test environment
       jest.clearAllMocks();
     });
     
     test('should initialize with default preferences', () => {
       const service = NotificationService.getInstance();
       const prefs = service.getPreferences();
       
       expect(prefs.allNotificationsEnabled).toBe(true);
       expect(prefs.pushNotificationsEnabled).toBe(true);
     });
     
     test('should update preferences correctly', async () => {
       const service = NotificationService.getInstance();
       await service.updatePreferences({ pushNotificationsEnabled: false });
       
       const prefs = service.getPreferences();
       expect(prefs.pushNotificationsEnabled).toBe(false);
     });
   });
   ```

3. **Test Automation**:
   - Configure Jest to run tests automatically on push/pull requests
   - Set up GitHub Actions workflow for continuous testing

## Documentation

1. **Create API Documentation Structure**:
   ```
   $ mkdir -p docs/api
   $ touch docs/api/NotificationService.md
   $ touch docs/api/WebSocketService.md
   ```

2. **Documentation Format**:
   ```markdown
   # NotificationService API
   
   ## Methods
   
   ### getInstance()
   
   Returns the singleton instance of NotificationService.
   
   ```typescript
   const notificationService = NotificationService.getInstance();
   ```
   
   ### getPreferences()
   
   Returns the current notification preferences.
   
   ```typescript
   const preferences = notificationService.getPreferences();
   ```
   
   ### updatePreferences(preferences: Partial<NotificationPreferences>)
   
   Updates notification preferences.
   
   ```typescript
   await notificationService.updatePreferences({ 
     pushNotificationsEnabled: false
   });
   ```
   ```

3. **Automated Documentation**:
   - Consider using TSDoc/JSDoc comments in code
   - Set up a documentation generation tool like TypeDoc
   - Include examples and usage patterns

## Integration Workflow

1. **Daily Process**:
   - Morning: Daily standup to track progress
   - Development: Build component/service with tests
   - Documentation: Update API docs for the component/service
   - End of day: Commit progress to shared tracking document

2. **Weekly Sync**:
   - Review component reuse opportunities
   - Test coverage review
   - Documentation completeness check

This approach ensures all team members are aligned, components are reusable, everything is properly tested, and documentation stays current with development.
