1.	Instruction Prompt:
I have started a new chat. 
We are developing an app as described in @EcoCart_Requirements.txt using Expo, React Native and Transcript. Use @cursorrules as a guide on coding styles. You may find the other documents relevant. Much work has been done. You may refer to @EcoCartChatHistory_20250315 in folder ./context_docs for where we have been in this app development and where we are headed, which is towards production. Document @progress_report_250314.md in folder ./context_docs gives an outline of our Roadmap. Document @StrategicRoadmapToProduction_2925-03-09.txt may also be a helpful input into the strategy. You may rehash them to create your own Roadmap document. There are several documents in ./docs that have been generated to describe various aspects of the project, as-done or intended, and a README.md in the root folder.
