1.	Instruction Prompt:
We are starting a new chat. 
We are developing an app as described in @EcoCart_Requirements.txt using Expo, React Native and Transcript. Use @cursorrules as a guide on coding styles. You may find the other documents relevant. Much work has been done. There is a missing chat history after @EcoCartChatHistory_20250316.md in folder ./context_docs that I have failed to retrieve. However, we have a comprehensive documentation system that that you must study and avail yourself to for the state of the app development towards production and an updated progress report @progress_report_250316.md in folder ./context_docs that provides a  Roadmap. Documentation must always be updated. Global documents are kept in ./docs while component level documents are found where the components are. Document @StrategicRoadmapToProduction_2925-03-09.txt is an original plan that may come in handy for a global strategic perspective.
