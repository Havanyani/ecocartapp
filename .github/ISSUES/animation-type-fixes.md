# Fix react-native-reanimated Type Definitions

## Current Status
The `AnimationOptimizer` component in `src/utils/AnimationOptimizer.ts` has TypeScript type issues with react-native-reanimated imports and types.

## Issues to Address
1. Fix import statements for react-native-reanimated
2. Add proper type definitions for Animated namespace
3. Fix SharedValue type definitions
4. Add proper type definitions for animation configs
5. Fix worklet type definitions

## Proposed Solutions
1. Update import statements to use correct syntax:
```typescript
import Animated, {
  useAnimatedStyle,
  useSharedValue,
  withSpring,
  withTiming,
  withSequence,
  withDelay,
  runOnJS,
} from 'react-native-reanimated';
```

2. Add proper type definitions for Animated namespace:
```typescript
import type { SharedValue, WithSpringConfig, WithTimingConfig } from 'react-native-reanimated';
```

3. Create proper type definitions for animation configs:
```typescript
interface AnimationConfig {
  duration: number;
  easing: (t: number) => number;
  useNativeDriver: boolean;
}
```

## Priority
Medium - Type safety is important but not blocking functionality

## Dependencies
- react-native-reanimated
- @types/react-native-reanimated
- TypeScript configuration

## Notes
- Component is currently working in production
- Type issues are tracked in TypeScript compiler
- Need to verify types against react-native-reanimated documentation
- May need to update react-native-reanimated version
