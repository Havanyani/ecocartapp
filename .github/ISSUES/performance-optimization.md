# Type Improvements for OptimizedImage Component

## Current Status
The `OptimizedImage` component in `src/hooks/useOptimizedImage.ts` is functionally working but has TypeScript type issues. We're currently using a `@ts-ignore` comment as a temporary solution.

## Issues to Address
1. Create proper type definitions for `expo-image` component
2. Fix type issues in `OptimizedImageProps` interface
3. Add proper typing for style prop
4. Add proper typing for contentFit prop
5. Add proper typing for source prop

## Proposed Solutions
1. Create a new type definition file `src/types/expo-image.d.ts` with proper types
2. Update `OptimizedImageProps` to extend from proper expo-image types
3. Add proper ViewStyle typing for style prop
4. Add proper ImageContentFit typing for contentFit prop
5. Add proper ImageSource typing for source prop

## Priority
Medium - Type safety is important but not blocking functionality

## Dependencies
- expo-image package
- @types/react-native
- TypeScript configuration

## Notes
- Component is currently working in production
- Type issues are tracked in TypeScript compiler
- Need to verify types against expo-image documentation
